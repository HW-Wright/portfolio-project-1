# The Bee People

My first Portfolio Project is a site for a fictional wildlife association whoâ€™s aim is to educate people about the importance of bees to the eco system, while raising awareness of the issues that bee species face. The target for the site is anyone who cares for the environment, it is visually appealing and provides information in simple terms so as to be accessible to people of all ages and backgrounds.
