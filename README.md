# The Bee People
My first Portfolio Project is a site for a fictional wildlife association whoâ€™s goal is to educate people about the importance of bees to the eco system, while raising awareness of the issues that bee species face. The target for the site is anyone who cares for the environment, it is visually appealing and provides information in simple terms so as to be accessible to people of all ages and backgrounds.

- At smaller screen sizes the block formation is completed by an animation of bee carryign honey. Each image contains an anchor and a question that will be answered by clicking on it.

## Design
### Layout
----------------------------
- The header and footer elements are identical on each page of the site, consisting of the site title on the left hand side, and site navigation on the right.
![Header element](/assets/images/header.jpeg)
![Footer element](/assets/images/footer.jpeg)
- index.html consists of three distinct secions, reflecting the rule of thirds. The first thrid is image based, while aslo acting as a navigation system for the page itself. The images are inline on large screens and stack as the viewport decreaces. 
![Splash element](/assets/images/splash-image.jpeg)
The second third is text based and sticks to the left side on medium sized screens, while becoming central on larger and smaller sized screens. The section consitsts of a list containing headers and paragraphs.
![Section 2](/assets/images/section2.jpeg)
The third third is text based and includes a table element. It sticks to the right side on medium sized screens, while becoming central on larger and smaller sized screens. On medium screens an animation plays in the empty space to the left of this section, while disapearing when the area becomes central.
![Section3](/assets/images/section3.jpeg)
- science.html also consists of three sections. One large section containing the video element and two smaller elements above and below.
Above the video element container is a page heading and message for the reader explaining the purpose and contents of the page.
![Science.html header](/assets/images/science.html-aside.jpeg)
Below the video element container is an external navigation section, providing links to other reasources to further educate the user, as per the aim of the site.
![Science.html external navigation](/assets/images/external-links.jpeg)
The central section of science.html consists of a video element within a container. The video is an external resource from YouTube, explaining the importance of bees to human civilisation. The video will not autoplay and the user has complete control over the video.
![Science.html video element](/assets/images/video.jpeg)
- sign-up.html cosists of a page header followed by a form to sign up for The Bee People's newsletter.
Within the form container a thank you message and appeal to the users sits at the top left. The form element occupies the space below and to the right.

### Color Scheme
----------------------------
The final color scheme went through several stages of development. Initially yellow text and element borders was to be set against a black backround. However this was found to be too dark and not in keeping with the natrualistic theme of the site. Instead, the current rich and dark gold text is set against a white background. In keeping with the theme of bees and the images that would be used for the site, I wanted to use the colors yellow and black for the text. The color #9E6E18 was chosen to make the text stand out more against the white background, over yellow. The text in the splash section is #2F2B11 which was chosen over black; as black was deemed to contrast too much with the bright images in this section. The footer is set to the warm golden color of #dfa640 with black AwsomeFont icons, to reflect the color scheme most accociated with the bee.
### Media
----------------------------
As well as the media presented in the layout section of this document, additional animations have been included for certain screen sizes.
- On a medium size screen the user will see an animation of a bee flying in a figure eight pattern to the left of Section 3 in index.html.

- When the viewport is reduced down to the size of a tablet or mobile device an additional animation of a bee carrying honey is introduced alongside the splash images in index.html.
